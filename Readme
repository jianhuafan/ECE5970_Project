select_sparse:
delete_sparse(data,threshold):input is a 2D list, output is also a 2D list
date_to_num(year,data): str_date 2 number, input & output both contain feature name row
label_to_num(data):input is 2D list, automatic find str labels and transform them into increment number
delete_columns(data,columns to be deleted): works fine
locf(input,label): currently, some manual work is needed is sort the list, and delete one of the rows with same PID and same exam date
pca()


Our order:
1.date_to_num
2.delete other data & sparse datta
3.(use change to store index of label)transform str & null to number
4.imutation: now we do locf and median imputation
5.hot-encoding
6.PCA
